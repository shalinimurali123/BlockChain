Question 1:
   BlockChain is a technology with a decentralised peer to peer network which facilitates more security and data transparency.
Question 2:
   The core problem that blockchain tries to solve is the need for a third party for trust, security of data and authenticity.
Question 3:
    -Security
    -Immutability
    -Tamper proof
    -Distributed network
    -Able to verify
    -Peer to Peer communication
Question 4:
    Block number,Data records. Previous hash key and mining key
Question 5:
    Blocks in a blockchain is verified by the other nodes in the distributed network. It is verified using the hash generated and if data is tampered, the change in hash
    prompts that the block has been tampered and has to verify its data to link in the chain.
